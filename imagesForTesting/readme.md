# Images for Testing

The subfolders here arranged by date contain images of cartridge headstamps captured using a cellphone. These can be used to test image upload, and ensure that metadata from the images can be extracted, stored, and retrieved.

## Image Metadata

The Exif format stores metadata in image files, and we should leverage this to collect information from submitted images to be used for image storage, retrieval, asset management, and potentially as hints for image classification, processing, and/or training.

Here's a [guide to Exif tags](https://www.exiftool.org/TagNames/EXIF.html)

For comparison of the data stored in images from different devices, see [exifData.md](./exifData.md)
